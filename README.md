## Overview

Monica is an open-source web application to organize the interactions with your loved ones. I call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Think of it as a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (a popular tool used by sales teams in the corporate world) for your friends or family.


**Shipped version:** 3.6.1~ynh1
