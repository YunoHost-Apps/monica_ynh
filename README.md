## Introduction

Monica is an open-source web application to organize the interactions with your loved ones. I call it a PRM, or Personal Relationship Management. Think of it as a [CRM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (a popular tool used by sales teams in the corporate world) for your friends or family.

## Install
##### This app will install PHP7.1 
```
 sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/monica_ynh
```
**First User Registraion:** Visit the app **domain** after the installtion is complete to register as **first user**. After the first user is registerd the registration will be **locked**. You can open the register for all by chaning the value **APP_DISABLE_SIGNUP** to **false** in **.env**. There is **no admin interface** in the Monica app currently.

## Update
```
 sudo yunohost app upgrade -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/monica_ynh monica
```
#### Change the settings of the app by changing the values in .env

## What works?
* [X] Update and remove script
* [X] Upgrade script
* [X] Backup and restore script (**Need testing**)
* [X] Multi-instance (**Need testing**)
* [x] make root domain redirect to index.php
* [x] Chang URL (Need testing,backup before trying this)
* [ ] LDAP/SSO support
* [ ] Make monica installable into subdirectory (eg. https://example.com/monica/)
  * Currently it is only possible to install monica into the root of a domain (eg. https://example.com/)
  * This is due to a limitation in monica, not yunohost!
  * See [here](https://github.com/monicahq/monica/issues/139) for the current progress.
